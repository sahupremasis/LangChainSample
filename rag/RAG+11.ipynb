So… Let’s discuss the not-so-obvious differences between the terms analysis and analytics. Due to the similarity of the words, some people believe they share the same meaning, and thus use them interchangeably. Technically, this isn’t correct. There is, in fact, a distinct difference between the two. And the reason for one often being used instead of the other is the lack of a transparent understanding of both. So, let’s clear this up, shall we? First, we will start with analysis'),\n",

Instead of tackling the entire dataset and running the risk of becoming overwhelmed, you separate it into easier to digest chunks and study them individually and examine how they relate to other parts. And that’s analysis in a nutshell. One important thing to remember, however, is that you perform analyses on things that have already happened in the past'),\n",

All this means that we do analyses to explain how and/or why something happened. Great! Now, this leads us nicely on to the definition of analytics. As you have probably guessed, analytics generally refers to the future. Instead of explaining past events it explores potential future ones'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Course Title': 'Introduction to Data and Data Science', 'Lecture Title': 'Analysis vs Analytics'}, page_content='Analytics is essentially the application of logical and computational reasoning to the component parts obtained in an analysis.
